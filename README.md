A 12- and 24-hour clock (Logisim and ModelSim)

The image is the clock designed with logic gates in Logisim. It is able to switch between 12- and 24-hours
however the AM and PM lights will always stay on.

The verilog code for the clock allows the user to set the time and alarm time. Also allows them to switch between 
12- and 24-hour time format. Snooze is added but does not function properly.
The testbench values can be changed to test the clock.
Code was done in ModelSim.

Goal: Come back to this project and fix snooze. Possibly use an FPGA once everything is set code wise.
